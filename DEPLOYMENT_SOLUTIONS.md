# Course Tracker - Deployment Solutions

## Problem
The original course tracker only worked locally because it relied on Node.js file system operations to scan local directories. This doesn't work in production deployments where the server can't access your local file system.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Upload-Based Scanner (✅ Implemented)
**Best for:** Local development and modern browsers
- **File:** `components/CourseScanner.tsx` + `app/api/scan-course/route.ts`
- **How it works:** Uses HTML5 file input with `webkitdirectory` to upload entire folders
- **Pros:** Maintains original folder structure, works with existing local courses
- **Cons:** May not work in all browsers, limited by file upload size limits

### 2. Manual Course Creator (✅ Implemented)
**Best for:** Production deployments, all environments
- **File:** `components/ManualCourseCreator.tsx`
- **How it works:** Manual form-based course structure creation
- **Pros:** Works everywhere, no file system dependencies
- **Cons:** Requires manual entry of course structure

### 3. Cloud-Based Course Scanner (✅ Implemented)
**Best for:** Cloud-hosted courses (YouTube, Vimeo, etc.)
- **File:** `app/api/cloud-course/route.ts`
- **How it works:** Processes URLs from cloud video platforms
- **Pros:** Perfect for online courses, scalable
- **Cons:** Requires video URLs, may need API keys for full functionality

## Deployment Recommendations

### For Vercel/Netlify Deployments:
1. **Primary:** Use Manual Course Creator for reliable course creation
2. **Secondary:** Use Upload Scanner for local development
3. **Future:** Implement cloud-based scanner for online courses

### For Traditional Servers:
1. Consider mounting network drives if you need file system access
2. Use upload-based scanner with proper file size limits
3. Implement cloud storage integration (AWS S3, Google Drive API)

## Current Status
✅ Upload-based scanner implemented
✅ Manual course creator implemented  
✅ Cloud course scanner foundation implemented
✅ Dashboard updated with tabbed interface
✅ Both solutions integrated into main app

## Next Steps
1. Add cloud storage integration (Google Drive, Dropbox)
2. Implement YouTube/Vimeo playlist import
3. Add video URL validation
4. Add progress tracking for uploaded courses
